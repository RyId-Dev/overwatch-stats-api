HTML Project to display user stats from Overwatch utilising the Overfast API


Milestones
 - Load JSON data from original nested array from data.json
 - Load info from multiple arrays in json
 - Format loaded data
 - Load data from in-line api call rather than static json
 - Change from in-line api call to api call based on player ID entered
 - At this stage code has only been loading stats from 1 hero/summary data. Test loading other api calls
 - Format HTML using framework (Bootstrap 5, Angular etc.) (Original GUI or Overwatch Style)

Future Milestones
